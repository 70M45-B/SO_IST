# SO_IST

## Operating Systems project
The goal of this project is to develop the IST "Event Management System" (IST-EMS), an event management system that allows the creation, reservation, and verification of ticket availability for events such as concerts and theatrical performances. IST-EMS explores parallelization techniques based on multiple processes and tasks to enhance request processing speed. Additionally, it focuses on implementing implementing scalable synchronization mechanisms between tasks and inter-process communication mechanisms (FIFOs and signals). Furthermore, IST-EMS will interact with the file system, providing an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with POSIX file system programming interfaces.
